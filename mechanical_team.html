After three years of working in Project Engineer and Associate Distribution Engineer roles, gaining invaluable project management and professional work experience, Thomas made the decision to return to school in pursuit of his Masters of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with the goal of one day working in the burgeoning space industry and achieve his dream of putting human beings into space. As a first semester graduate student at Arizona State University’s Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, Thomas quickly became involved with the AZLoop Hyperloop Design Team as an opportunity to research and design one of the most exciting up and coming technologies in the engineering field today. As the a Co-Lead of the Mechanical Team, Thomas uses his project management and leadership experience to help the team efficiently develop and integrate the mechanical team’s visions into a cohesive Hyperloop pod. Outside of school and Hyperloop, Thomas is an avid Seattle sports fan and likes to take advantage of Arizona’s climate with his fiancee, staying outdoors and active, whether on the trail or the soccer field.">  Learn More</a></p>

From his experience working hourly jobs in high school, He found out that he excels at quick learning and wanted to apply his skills to something more challenging. He then applied to Arizona State University for Mechanical Engineering (Major) and Engineering Management (Minor) and got accepted. He believes joining Hyperloop is a great opportunity to apply all the knowledge he’s learned so far in his education, and accomplish something wonderful with a group of intellectual hard working students. When he’s not working on Hyperloop or school work, he is writing music and playing drums for his band I Remember Burning. He has  been playing music since before he can remember, and plan to never stop playing music.

This project offered him an opportunity to work with a group of ridiculously smart people synergised to help realise the dream of the Hyperloop. The cross departmental nature of operations involved in this project made for an incredible learning experience. Just the excitement of building something so pioneering from scratch is almost incentive enough to want to do what we do. Also an industrial engineer, Hyperloop provides him with the perfect platform to improve his skill set and hands on experience in manufacturing technology and systems engineering.When he is not working on building the pod, in class or working on anything academically inclined, he enjoy sports, hiking, movies, binge eating and travelling.">  Learn More</a></p>

At a young age, he was exposed to the fascinating things his father would bring home from Agilent Technologies as an electrical engineer. Constantly seeing the little things that go into making what most take for granted was extremely exciting to him. Prior to officially pursuing engineering, he was an avid classical musician. He saw his first violin at 4 years old while watching Sesame St, he begged my parents for lessons that ended up lasting over 13 years. Being able to understand music further gave into his fascination of how things are made, or “composed” in this sense, and helped to develop his analytical way of thinking.  In highschool his spark for engineering grew when he was given the opportunity to join the Maker class and use his school’s laser engraver, giving him a window into the possibilities that may be in his future. After not quite looking through that “window”, he enrolled as a business student at ASU and had the most academically miserable year of his life. That summer he switched into what many thought would “be the death of me”, mechanical engineering. The daily challenges he faces as an engineering major never discourage him. He has grown exponentially as a person since switching over to something more applicable to his personality and interest. Being able to participate in projects like General Motor’s EcoCar 3 and SpaceX’s AZloop give him the same beaming face he had 15 years ago seeing his dad bring things home from work.">  Learn More</a></p>

He chose Aeronautical Engineering as a halfway point between two fascinations: space and building things. Ever since elementary school he’s been interested in how things work and how the world works. This led him to space, physics, and science as a whole. On the other hand, he liked learning how things work because he enjoys building things. He decided that the best way to combine these to career options was to build things to learn more about the world around us. Ever since he can remember he’s had a knack for building. It started with building forts but slowly evolved into building with anything and everything he could get his hands on, and now he’s going to make it into a career through college.">  Learn More</a></p>
